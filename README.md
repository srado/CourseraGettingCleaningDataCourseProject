# Coursera Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project

This is a repo for the project of the coursera Getting & Cleaning Data course of Coursera.

# Overview

This project demonstrates the ability of collecting, working with and cleaning a data set. The included R script does the following on the data found here https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip:

1. Downloads the dataset
2. Loads the activity and feature information
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
7.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
